## Node classification

### Zachary's karate club

These are data collected from the members of a university karate club by Wayne Zachary. Zachary (1977) used these data and an information flow model of network conflict resolution to explain the split-up of this group following disputes among the members.

### PubMed

The Pubmed dataset consists of 19717 scientific publications from PubMed database pertaining to diabetes classified into one of three classes. The citation network consists of 44338 links. Each publication in the dataset is described by a TF/IDF weighted word vector from a dictionary which consists of 500 unique words.

### Facebook Page-Page

This webgraph is a page-page graph of verified Facebook sites. Nodes represent official Facebook pages while the links are mutual likes between sites. Node features are extracted from the site descriptions that the page owners created to summarize the purpose of the site. This graph was collected through the Facebook Graph API in November 2017 and restricted to pages from 4 categories which are defined by Facebook. These categories are: politicians, governmental organizations, television shows and companies. The task related to this dataset is multi-class node classification for the 4 site categories.

## Node regression

### Wikipedia Network

The data was collected from the English Wikipedia (December 2018). These datasets represent page-page networks on specific topics (chameleons, crocodiles and squirrels). Nodes represent articles and edges are mutual links between them. The presence of a feature in the feature list means that an informative noun appeared in the text of the Wikipedia article. The target csv contains the node identifiers and the average monthly traffic between October 2017 and November 2018 for each page. The goal is to predict the log average monthly traffic of December 2018. PyTorch Geometric has a node classification variant of this dataset, where the goal is to predict the correct bin.

| **Name** | **Nodes** | **Edges** | **Features** | **Classes** |
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Chameleon | 2,277 | 31,421 | 2,325 | Continuous |
| Crocodile | 11,631 | 170,918 | 2,325 | Continuous |
| Squirrel | 5,201 | 198,493 | 2,325 | Continuous |
